  				He is glad to hear you finally apologize and he apologizes again too. You guys pass by a exotic car dealership and you can't help but stare at the beauty of the cars. He notices this, and he jokes that his Honda drives just fine. You tell him that weren't here for the money and he gives a wide grin. It turned out that he had a brand new supercar waiting for you in the dealership parking lot if this date went well. Congratulations.
