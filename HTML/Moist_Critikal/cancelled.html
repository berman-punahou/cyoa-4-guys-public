  				You finally speak up and express your fustration at him, telling him you're going to leave. Surprisingly, he laughs, and tells you that he dodged a bullet and starts heading off. The next day, you wake up with thousands of notifications on your phone, all of which were hateful comments and angry DMs. You realized what happened, and open up Charlie's YouTube channel. Turns out he's made a video about this date and his internet fans were somehow able to indentify who you were through the show, and have begun to strip your reputation piece by piece. Maybe you should've just apologized after all.
